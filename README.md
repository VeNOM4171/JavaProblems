# Automorphic Number

Number is said tobe Automorphic number if and only if its sqaure ends in the same digits as the number itself.
 
### Example
76 is Automorphic as in 76*76=5776, 76=76(last two digit of square of number) 

45 is not Automorphic as in 45*45=2025, 45!=25

# Triangle Type 

It takes sides of triangle as input and finds the type of Triangle 

like
### 1)Equivalent 
if Three sides are equal
### 2)Isosceles
if two sides are equal
### 3)Scalene 
if all three sides are different
### 4)Right Angled Triangle
if one of three angles equals 90

# Find Point
 
 Program to Find a point whether it is inside the area of Triangle or outside.
 
 The Coordinates of Random Point P(x,y) & Points of Triangle is Taken as Input like Point A(x1,y1), B(x2,y2), C(x3,y3) 
 if point found inside the Area output "Inside" otherwise "Outside"

# BreadthFirstSearch

BFS is an Algorithm that Searches through graphs.

In BFS user can decide the starting point to begin the search and also can decide the end point 
but for simplicity,here first node is selected as starting point and last node is selected as end point.

adjacency matrix of order nxn (n is total number of node) is used to store the info of edges

'1' if there is edge, '0' if no edges(default)
